        content: "It's been a while since I have published anything and I'm totally out of practice of blogging due to multiple reasons. It is very difficult to get back into the groove and gain confidence to start writing. So, in this random blog, I'll keep it very simple. I just aim to write about the various good things which we need to pay attention to in our life. Seems very dull? Let's see. Our lives can get so hectic and target driven(be it personal growth or professional) that we often miss to pay attention to small aspects of our life. For example, I do not recollect having a proper and in-depth conversation with my family/friends to be available for those who need me. I also don't recollect when was the last time I saw and enjoyed a proper sunrise or for that matter, the last time I properly had a meaningful conversation with anyone.",

        title: "Human intelligence must guide artificial intelligence",
        content: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are developing at a rapid pace, and touching our lives in unimagined ways. On one hand, AI is enhancing several day-to-day functions and improving productivity. On the other hand, there are fears that it may lead to redundancy and replacement of humans at work. As AI expands in scope and gets deployed on an increasingly wider scale, the question on everyone’s lips is: What will human intelligence look like in the future?While it is true that AI will reinvent traditional methods of working and automate certain tasks, it will also create many new jobs that require new skills. According to a report, the skills needed for most jobs by 2030 will have changed by 65 percent compared to 2015 owing to the integration of digital technologies, including AI. More importantly, these skills will not just include technical skills but also human capabilities such as problem solving, critical thinking, innovation, and time management. People will neither be swept aside by AI transformation, nor will they passively watch it evolve. Instead, human intelligence will be an integral part of the AI journey, and crucial to its success.",

        content: "In 2023, Thunderbird, although considered an older email client, appears to be regaining popularity. If you previously abandoned it in favor of the user-friendly Gmail or the sleek Mail app on Mac, it might be worth giving Thunderbird another chance after all these years.Why it lost popularity in the first place? As I understand it there are two main reasons for this. The first one is that as an open source project it didn’t have strong leadership with a unified vision, so all kind of features were added to it without too much consideration – which although made it powerful and customizable, also made it hard to maintain and didn’t made it easy to use.What were the primary factors contributing to its decline in popularity initially? From my understanding, there are two key reasons behind this shift. The first reason is attributed to the absence of strong leadership and a cohesive vision within the open-source project. This resulted in the addition of various features without thorough deliberation. While this approach enhanced its power and customization capabilities, it simultaneously posed challenges in terms of maintenance and user-friendliness.",

        content: "He created Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? He got an Oscar nomination for writing 2002’s Dirty Pretty Things. And he turned Birmingham into the coolest place on the planet with Peaky Blinders. Now Steven Knight is back in Brum with This Town, his fictional BBC drama set in the world of ska and two-tone in the early 1980s. As the show reaches its final episode this Sunday on BBC One (April 28) , Knight sits down with NME to talk music and movies – including the forthcoming big-screen Peaky outing, his Maria Callas biopic with Angelina Jolie and his move into the Star Wars universe with New Jedi Order.Hi Steven, what inspired This Town?“I wanted to do a Birmingham and West Midlands story. And I remember as a kid at school, people would get these 45s, these singles, that would come from Jamaica. And they’d play them and everybody loved them because they had lyrics that would never make it onto the radio (they were quite suggestive). In Coventry, lots of people were suddenly listening to ska music. And then people started making their own versions of it. Skinheads and young Black people [were mixing] without there being trouble. It was just a strange thing that happened in that location at that time, and I just thought it would be great to tell a story with that as the background.”.",

        content: "Despite witnessing a sustained surge in funding and global investor interest in the past few years, the Indian edtech sector, grapples with persistent allegations of subpar corporate governance. Many players in the ecosystem struggle to align governance standards with their growth and results. It leads to layoffs, accusations of unfair trade practices, and gaps in bookkeeping.While the allure of investor interest in this nascent and promising market brings substantial valuations and capital, the sector must not lose sight of the fundamental principles of good business. Balancing growth with integrity, accountability, and ethical decision-making is paramount to building a resilient ecosystem that safeguards the interests of all stakeholders and fosters innovation, knowledge dissemination, and holistic growth.In the edtech industry, placing students at the core of the business and adopting a straightforward framework that other companies can learn from and implement is essential.",
